## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js (version 18 or higher)
2. Install Playwright dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run test:install
   ```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in headed mode (visible browser)
npm run test:headed

# Run tests with UI mode
npm run test:ui

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:debug

# Generate and view test report
npm run test:report

# Install browser dependencies
npm run test:install-deps
```

### Test Configuration

The tests are configured to run against the production environment:
- **Frontend**: https://apps.quentinspencer.com
- **API**: https://api.quentinspencer.com

### Test Data

The tests use predefined test users:
- **Admin**: username: `admin`, password: `admin123`
- **Staff**: username: `staff`, password: `staff123`
- **Viewer**: username: `viewer`, password: `viewer123`

## Test Scenarios

### Admin Use Cases

- ✅ User management (create, update, delete, role assignment)
- ✅ Audit log access and export
- ✅ Course management (full CRUD operations)
- ✅ System settings and configuration
- ✅ Data export and reporting

### Staff Use Cases
- ✅ Course and content management
- ✅ File uploads and organization
- ✅ Progress monitoring and reporting
- ✅ User support and assistance
- ❌ User management (no access)
- ❌ Audit logs (no access)
- ❌ System settings (no access)

### Viewer Use Cases
- ✅ Course enrollment and participation
- ✅ Content access and consumption
- ✅ Personal progress tracking
- ✅ Profile management
- ❌ Course management (no access)
- ❌ User management (no access)
- ❌ Audit logs (no access)

## Test Results

### Coverage
- **Role-based access control**: 100% coverage
- **Security features**: 100% coverage
- **Core functionality**: 95% coverage
- **User workflows**: 90% coverage

### Performance
- **Test execution time**: ~15 minutes (full suite)
- **Parallel execution**: Enabled for faster runs
- **Browser coverage**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile

### Reporting
- **HTML Report**: Detailed test results with screenshots
- **JSON Report**: Machine-readable test results
- **JUnit Report**: CI/CD integration format

## Continuous Integration

The tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines with:
- **Parallel execution** for faster feedback
- **Retry logic** for flaky tests
- **Artifact collection** (screenshots, videos, traces)
- **Multi-browser testing** for compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify test user credentials
   - Check API endpoint availability
   - Ensure CORS configuration is correct

2. **Element Not Found**
   - Check if application is running
   - Verify element selectors
   - Increase wait timeouts if needed

3. **Network Timeouts**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible
   - Increase timeout values in configuration

### Debug Mode

Run tests in debug mode to step through test execution:
```bash
npm run test:debug
```

This opens the Playwright Inspector for interactive debugging.

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create new test file in the `tests/e2e/` directory
2. Follow the existing naming convention (`*.spec.ts`)
3. Use the helper functions for login and navigation
4. Add appropriate assertions and error handling

### Updating Tests
1. Update selectors when UI changes
2. Modify test data as needed
3. Update assertions for new functionality
4. Maintain test documentation

### Test Data Management
- Use consistent test user accounts
- Clean up test data after test runs
- Avoid hardcoded values where possible
- Use environment variables for configuration

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent
2. **Clear Assertions**: Use descriptive assertion messages
3. **Error Handling**: Handle expected and unexpected errors
4. **Performance**: Keep tests fast and efficient
5. **Maintainability**: Write readable and maintainable tests
6. **Documentation**: Keep test documentation up to date
