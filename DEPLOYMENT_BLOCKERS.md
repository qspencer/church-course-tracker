# 🚧 Deployment Blockers - Why We Can't Deploy Yet

## ❌ Missing Prerequisites on This Machine

### 1. **Terraform Not Installed**
```bash
$ which terraform
(command not found)
```
**Status:** ❌ NOT INSTALLED  
**Needed For:** Applying infrastructure changes (creating API Gateway, removing ALB)

### 2. **AWS CLI Not Installed**
```bash
$ aws --version
Command 'aws' not found
```
**Status:** ❌ NOT INSTALLED  
**Needed For:** Interacting with AWS services, verifying deployment

### 3. **AWS Credentials Not Configured**
**Status:** ❌ NOT CONFIGURED  
**Needed For:** Authenticating with AWS to create/modify resources

### 4. **pip/Python Environment Issues**
```bash
$ pip3
Command 'pip3' not found
```
**Status:** ❌ NOT INSTALLED  
**Needed For:** Running backend tests locally

## 🎯 Three Ways to Deploy

### **Option 1: Use GitHub Actions (Recommended)** ⭐

**This doesn't require ANY local tools!**

**Steps:**
1. **Set up GitHub Secrets** (via GitHub web interface):
   - Go to: `Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`
   - Add these 5 secrets:
     - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
     - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
     - `DATABASE_URL`
     - `S3_STATIC_BUCKET`
     - `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID`

2. **Commit and push the code:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Add CI/CD pipeline and migrate to API Gateway"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Watch GitHub Actions deploy everything:**
   - Backend tests will run
   - Frontend tests will run
   - Infrastructure will be deployed
   - Application will be deployed
   - E2E tests will run against production

**Timeline:** 15-20 minutes  
**Requires:** Only git and GitHub access  
**Cost:** $0 (GitHub Actions is free for public repos, has free tier for private)

---

### **Option 2: Install Tools Locally**

**If you want to deploy from this machine:**

```bash
# 1. Install AWS CLI
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

# 2. Configure AWS credentials
aws configure
# Enter: Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Region (us-east-1), Format (json)

# 3. Install Terraform
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.6.6/terraform_1.6.6_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_1.6.6_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/

# 4. Deploy infrastructure
cd infrastructure
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

# 5. Deploy application (via GitHub Actions or manually)
```

**Timeline:** 30-45 minutes (including tool installation)  
**Requires:** sudo access, AWS credentials

---

### **Option 3: Use AWS CloudShell**

**Deploy directly from AWS Console:**

1. **Log into AWS Console**
2. **Click CloudShell icon** (>_ button in top nav)
3. **Upload your code:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/church-course-tracker.git
   cd church-course-tracker/infrastructure
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

**Timeline:** 20-30 minutes  
**Requires:** AWS Console access  
**Benefit:** Terraform and AWS CLI pre-installed

---

## 💡 Best Approach: GitHub Actions

**Why I recommend Option 1 (GitHub Actions):**

1. ✅ **No local setup required** - Everything runs in the cloud
2. ✅ **Automated testing** - Tests run before deployment
3. ✅ **Consistent environment** - Same every time
4. ✅ **Audit trail** - All deployments logged
5. ✅ **Rollback capability** - Easy to revert
6. ✅ **Future-proof** - Works for your team, CI/CD ready

**With Option 1, you just need:**
- Git (which you have ✅)
- GitHub access (which you have ✅)
- AWS credentials for GitHub secrets
- 5 minutes to set up secrets

## 🔐 Getting AWS Credentials

**If you don't have AWS credentials yet:**

### Option A: Create IAM User (Recommended for GitHub Actions)
1. Log into AWS Console
2. Go to: IAM → Users → Add user
3. User name: `github-actions-deployer`
4. Access type: Programmatic access
5. Permissions: Attach existing policies:
   - `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess`
   - `AmazonECS_FullAccess`
   - `AmazonS3FullAccess`
   - `CloudFrontFullAccess`
   - `AmazonRDSFullAccess`
   - Or create custom policy
6. Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

### Option B: Use Root Credentials (Not Recommended)
If you're the AWS account owner, you can use root credentials, but it's better to create an IAM user.

### Option C: Use Existing Terraform State
If infrastructure is already deployed:
```bash
# Check if resources exist
aws ecs describe-clusters
aws rds describe-db-instances
```

## 🎯 Immediate Next Step

**Since you can't deploy locally, let's use GitHub Actions:**

1. **Do you have the AWS credentials?** (Access Key ID and Secret Key)
   - If YES → I'll guide you through setting up GitHub secrets
   - If NO → I'll guide you through creating an IAM user

2. **Is your code on GitHub?**
   - If YES → Just add secrets and push
   - If NO → Let's push it first

3. **Have you deployed to AWS before?**
   - If YES → We can update existing infrastructure
   - If NO → We'll create everything from scratch

## 📊 What Happens When You Deploy

### Via GitHub Actions (Recommended):

**When you push to GitHub:**

```
1. Git push to main branch (1 minute)
   ↓
2. GitHub Actions triggered automatically
   ↓
3. Backend tests run (3-5 minutes)
   ↓
4. Frontend tests run (5-7 minutes)
   ↓
5. Docker image built and pushed to ECR (5-10 minutes)
   ↓
6. Database migrations run (1-2 minutes)
   ↓
7. ECS service updated (2-5 minutes)
   ↓
8. Frontend built and deployed to S3 (2-3 minutes)
   ↓
9. CloudFront cache invalidated (1-2 minutes)
   ↓
10. E2E tests run against production (5-10 minutes)
   ↓
11. ✅ Deployment complete!
```

**Total Time:** 20-30 minutes  
**Your Involvement:** Just push code and monitor progress

## 🚀 Let's Deploy!

**Answer these questions:**

1. Do you have AWS credentials (Access Key ID + Secret Key)?
2. Is this code already on GitHub?
3. Do you want me to:
   - Help set up GitHub Actions deployment? (recommended)
   - Help install tools locally?
   - Provide AWS CloudShell instructions?

**Once you answer, I'll guide you through the exact steps!**

---

## 📞 Bottom Line

**You CAN deploy, just not from this local machine without installing tools.**

**The BEST way is GitHub Actions** - it's already set up and ready to go. You just need to:
1. Add 5 secrets to GitHub (2 minutes)
2. Push the code (30 seconds)
3. Watch it deploy automatically (20 minutes)

**No Terraform or AWS CLI installation needed!** 🎉
